### SSL Certificates for local development or production system
##### PRE-REQUISITE
To generate valid SSL certificates, I use a free open source service provided by [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). These certificates have a validity period of 90 days, but they can be renewed. The only thing you need to be wary of are their [rate limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/). I suggest you test using the option parameter `--dry-run` to test for validation checks, omitting this when you need to generate the actual certificate to use on your server. The prerequisite for validation is that the domain you want to use **must be publicly reachable**. There are multiple [validation methods](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/), but I'll be using DNS as it's the most clean and easy method (nothing to create and clean up afterwards).

_If you don't have your own domain, you could use a free service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/free) with http validation._

For this guide, it is assumed you are using a development environment that is UNIX/Linux based. If your setup is different, there are [other clients](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/client-options/#acme-v2-compatible-clients) that may be compatible with your system. My development environment is...
```
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
Ubuntu 18.04 Distribution
```
##### Installation
First step is to install certbot, so start up your favourite shell and enter the following commands:
```shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository universe
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-dns-cloudflare
```
On the last command, `python3-certbot-dns-cloudflare` is the DNS plug-in name. My choice is to use Cloudflare, but you could use any of the other supported [DNS Plugins](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#dns-plugins).

##### Domain choice
For a production environment, you'll most likely want a single certificate for each site due to security risks. For development, it makes more sense to have a 'catch-all' domain so we can use the same certificate for all our development sites. I'd suggest something like, `dev.yourdomain.com` or `local.yourdomain.com`. For our local sites, we then set them up as sub-domains and modify our hosts file appropriately to point to `127.0.0.1`.

##### Cloudflare API
Create a text file to store your account email and API key and make sure the permissions of the file are something like `600 root:root` to prevent access from prying eyes. The file should contain something like:
```ini
dns_cloudflare_email = "your.email@example.com"
dns_cloudflare_api_key = "your-api-key"
```

> Run certbot commands with `-q` flag to suppress output, and `-n` for non-interactive mode

##### Generate Certificate
```shell
sudo certbot certonly -d "dev.example.com,*.dev.example.com" --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials <path_to_file>/cloudflare.ini --dns-cloudflare-propagation-seconds 10
```
The above command can also be used to _**renew certificates for specific domains**_. Generated certificate files are not physically in the `live` directory as the letscrypt output suggests - these are sym links to actual files in 'archive' directory. The files we are interested in for our site(s) are `cert` and `privkey` pem files. These correlate to `<domain>.crt` and `<domain>.key` respectively. On a production system, you should also implement the `chain` file for OCSP Stapling. 

##### Renew All Certificates
```shell
sudo certbot renew --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials <path_to_file>/cloudflare.ini --dns-cloudflare-propagation-seconds 10
```

##### Outro
The Cloudflare dns authentication automatically adds/removes the required dns entries for us, but it is also possible to to use shell scripts as hooks to have a custom process (useful for custom installation of ssl certificates on webserver). See the [Certbot Documentation](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#pre-and-post-validation-hooks) for more details on this.

It may be helpful to set up the renew command with -n (and suppress output with -r if you don't care) in a cron job to keep your certificates up to date.
